`                              `when your plow is a pencil, 

`                                             `and you're a thousand miles 

`                                                                        `from the corn field.”

**FARM SOLUTION WITH IOT**

`                                   `Abstract

**I**nformation technology is important in our lives because it helps to deal with every day’s dynamic things. Technology offers various tools to boost development and to exchange information. Both these things are the objective of IT to make tasks easier and to solve many problems. The common farmer is in a difficult position to buy different softwares and corresponding  hardwarews for even the basic functionalities .This in turn increases the complexity and difficulty to maintain each device and log record  cumbersome.In this project ,users can include other users as well as properties ,farms,products,employees and gadgets .Gadget status can be seen in real-time and decisions can also be automated to meet user needs such as irrigation ,lights inside and outside farms, water change for controlled growing environment and all the real time status of production environment and states.The customer can add any number of properties, farms with many category such as paddy field with associated sensors,warehouses,and custom categories and features. The primary motive of this project is to integrate farm activities to a single ecommerce(purchase and sale, delivery ,feedback and reviews,order tracking),automation web platform.In a full stack web app,we include admin,staff,and customer and integrate product sales,farm management(live stock),as well as farm automation using iot.The user can add several other users with roles like farm managers , staff and incorporate their attendance and salary.Sensors play an important role in this project,where user can add sensors and evaluate efficiency and performance.

**System Design of proposed System**:

This user management system is designed in such a way that it takes fewer resources to work properly.

`            `This doesn't uses any particular framework

It has its own sort of minimum requirements that we need to take care of:

The system needs a minimum of 2 GB of ram to run all the features smoothly and suddenly.

It needs a minimum of 1.3 GHz processor to run smoothly as less than that may create problems.

The system needs to be operated by some authorized person as wrong hands can make it irresponsible.

Rest is all up to the user’s usage will care for hardware.

The system should be made properly and tests should be done as per the requirements. 

So, the rest of the things depend on the user and no one can harm the data or the software if the proper care is done. 

All the attributes are working perfectly and if any error is found then it can be removed easily.

**Functional and Non-Functional Requirements of user Management System**

**Functional Requirements of User  Management System: –**

A few of its functional requirements are as given below: –

User data should be fed into the system: this system is doing that properly in the user entity.

Admin can manage the users: Admin can verify users, which is what they are doing with this system.





**Non-Functional Requirement user Management System: –**


The system’s overall properties remarkably mark the distinction between whether or not the event project has succeeded or unsuccessful.

Non-functional necessities – are often divided into 2 main categories:

Execution qualities, like security and usefulness, that square measure evident at the run time.

Evolution qualities, like liabilities, maintainability, flexibility, and quantifiable, that square measure embodied within the static structure of the code.

Here we need to take care of few more things before heading towards the system. The most important feature of the application world is the application’s ease of usage. the application will easy to use if made while keeping in mind that the user need not think twice about searching any feature.

Everything should be made distinctive by using the color combination such that everything needed most frequently highlighted with focus colors. We can use simple layouts like the card and grid layout etc. By varying color and other UI combinations, many good intuitive interfaces can be made. Which ultimately makes the interface easy to use for a long time.

Unlike ancient style wherever the goal is to form the thing or application physically enticing, the goal of interface style is to form the user’s interaction expertise as straightforward and intuitive as attainable – what’s typically known as user-centered style. Where smart graphic/industrial style is daring and eye-catching, smart interface style is commonly delicate and invisible.






Keep things simple and consistent: –

Simple and Harmonic way making UI is very intuitive and needs to be followed.

Make good use of typography: –

The typography is taken care of very strictly as the need of the system.

Use color and contrast properly: –

Color combo of lite and dark is a good way to emphasize and done well in this system.

Consider feedback messages: –

The feedback form is a very good way of taking feedback from forms and improving the system.

Simplified forms: –

The form is made simple to fill with the clean user interface.

**Types of feasibility** **analyzed**


it is related to how much the solution benefits the organization. It is verified if there will be adherence to the use of the solution by the users due to the organizational culture and the perception of those involved;whether the solution is aligned with the organization’s strategic objectives; whether there is understanding and support from the organization’s top management in relation to the project, etc.
**Organizational viability:**

Currently the project's interest in development is not aligned to that of any organization. the project is done in behalf of mca integrated programme‘s s9 mini project 2022

**Operational viability**: it is related to how much the solution suits the organization;  the proposed project is a web based software  with the help of iot so it requires requirements such as iot sensors and modules electrical hardware and system to run the webpage and network. what the customer expects the system to to be an integrated platform for farming;

analysis between the development cost and the benefits after the project is implemented (cost-benefit).

**Economic viability:** 

The cost benefit is very much aligned towards the user and customers.

linked to the technical support that the organization will offer for the development of the project .Team or technology restrictions; need to invest in research before carrying out the project; etc.

Timeline feasibility: crossing between the activities surveyed and the estimated time to carry them out; definition of project milestones; impact of delays.

**Technical software feasibility**: 

The  proposed software isn't dependent on on-development software.But is dependent on internet,iot technologies and web based application development i.e html5 css3,vanilla js and linries.

**Others:** **legal, cultural, marketing, etc**.

PIECES framework for software feasibility study

A tip that can be found when analyzing operational feasibility is to use a framework to categorize problems (checklist) and assist in requirements gathering, called PIECES. This methodology was created in 1994 by James Wetherbe and serves to analyze systems in order to solve problems, explore opportunities and meet established objectives; it also ensures that both analysts and users “speak the same language” when contributing to the definition of project requirements. The name PIECES comes from the acronym, where each letter categorizes a problem: Performance, Information, Economics, Control, Efficiency and Security.

`           `**Performance**: 

the proposed software’s performance can be understood from the queries:

Does the current system or operation offer adequate flow and response time?

` `It also relates to the maximum amount of processing that the system can perform.

`          `**Information:** Does the current operation provide stakeholders with correct, useful, and timely information?

it uses real time db for data read and write

` `Is the information organized and easily found?

The project uses abstract db ie google firebase which uses an api for request and response.

`          `**Economy:** 

Does the current operation offer information services such as cost/efficiency suitable for the organization? 

Can there be cost savings?

`             `How to increase profit?

`         `**Control:** involves security. How to manage information security to prevent fraud or potential breaches of privacy, but without bureaucratizing or creating controls that delay operation.

`       `**Efficiency**: 

` `analyze activities that waste time, mainly caused by redundancy.

` `How are resources being used?

`        `**Services:**

` `How accurate is the system?

It may be affected by the dependent s/w and hardware products.

` `Do you offer reliable services?

The Reliability offered is market standard

Describe clearly and succinctly the objective of the project. Writing characteristics focused on the executive level. Use phrases in the infinitive.
**Purpose** 

The most important feature of the application world is the application’s ease of usage. The application will be easy to use if made while keeping in mind that the user need not think twice about searching any feature.

Describe the scope of the project, highlighting the aspects that will be and will not be covered. Delimit the frontier of action. For aspects not covered: justify why they will not be attended to. The information stated here, may be more high-level.
**Scope** 

Describe the customer’s current situation. Inform if in the current environment there is already a software product running that will be replaced or integrated into the new solution. In this case, describe the software, its version, supplier, a brief description of its characteristics and how it is used. Emphasize the current environment and the difficulties of that environment. If he does not have any software, indicate how he controls his business manually. Attach documents like receipts, contracts, spreadsheets, reports and even take pictures if possible.
